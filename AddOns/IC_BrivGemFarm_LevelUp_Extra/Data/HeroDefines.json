For the next ten weeks you'll be able to complete Challenges, earn rewards, and vote to influence the events of The \"C\" Team episodes each Wednesday at 4PM PDT. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are Challenges?</span> Challenges are in-game tasks that you can complete to earn points. Challenges come in a variety of difficulties, with corresponding point values for each. New challenges unlock every week. Each Challenge is available to complete for the two weeks after it unlocks, with some exceptions (see below). After two weeks any unfinished Challenges will no longer be completable. There are two special types of Challenge each week: Omin's Challenge, and the Daily Challenge. <span class=\"italic_title\">What is Omin's Challenge?</span> Omin's Challenge, when completed in the current week, grants not only a bunch of points but also the ability to vote in the poll to influence the events of the next episode of The \"C\" Team! If you complete Omin's Challenge after a new week of Challenges have unlocked, it will not grant the ability to vote, but it will still give you a boat-load of points. Once unlocked, you can vote in the poll once per day (resetting at noon PDT each day). <span class=\"italic_title\">What is the Daily Challenge?</span> Daily Challenges can be completed multiple times per week (once a day, resetting at noon PDT each day). Daily Challenges update each week, and only the current week's Daily Challenge is available. <span class=\"italic_title\">What can I earn from Challenges?</span> Each Challenge awards a certain number of points. Points can be redeemed for a fixed set of rewards. Each reward requires you to have collected a certain number of points. Your points are not consumed when you redeem rewards, so if you have an available reward, claim it! Milestone rewards appear every 350 points, and include Gold Chests, a unique outfit for Asharra, a Golden Epic for Donaar (which also unlocks Donaar if you don't already have him), and a Potion of Polish (upgrades a random piece of gear to Shiny). <span class=\"italic_title\">Where can I watch 'C' Team episodes?</span> Acquisitions Incorporated: The \"C\" Team broadcasts every week on Wednesday at 4pm PDT on the Penny Arcade twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/PennyArcade/).

You can start the adventures from the Campaign Map just like you would any other adventure, except that you must spend Event Tokens (Giftboxes) to start them. The base adventures will unlock new Champions, and the variants and free plays provide chests that can be used to gear them up. When the event ends, you keep the new Champions, any gear you have acquired for them, and gain a boost to your permanent campaign favor. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get more Event Tokens (Giftboxes)?</span> Event Tokens will drop periodically from monsters in all adventures and campaigns. You will also receive Event Tokens along with your offline gold gains when you load the game after having been offline for a while. Finally, using Bounty Contracts during the event will award Event Tokens at a rate of 2.4 per minute (72 for small contracts, 576 for medium, and 1152 for large). <span class=\"italic_title\">How do Free Play costs work?</span> The free play variants initially only cost 500 Event Tokens. Each time you successfully earn a chest from one, the cost is increased by 500, up to a maximum cost of 2500. The cost increase is tracked per free play, so earning a chest from one will not increase the cost for the others. This gives you four discounted free play attemps per Champion, saving a total of 5000 tokens each. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I use the new Champion I've unlocked?</span> Once you complete one of the event's base adventures, you can swap in the new Champion you've unlocked by clicking on the portrait of whomever they swap with, then clicking the swap button the top-right corner of their portrait on their character sheet.

In each event you can complete adventures to unlock and gear up new and reworked Champions. You start event adventures from the Campaign Map just like you would any other adventure. The base adventure will unlock the Champion, and the variants provide chests that can be used to gear them up. When the event ends, you keep your new Champions along with any gear or other items you have acquired during the event, and gain a boost to your permanent campaign favor.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are Event Tokens?</span> \r\n\r\nEvent Tokens will drop periodically from monsters in all adventures and campaigns. They can be used to purchase additional chests for Champions during the event. You will receive Event Tokens along with your offline gold gains when you load the game after having been offline for a while. Finally, using Bounty Contracts during the event will award Event Tokens at a rate of 2.4 per minute (72 for small contracts, 576 for medium, and 1152 for large).\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are Event Tiers?</span> \r\n\r\nOnce you have completed all three of the variants for a given Champion's event, the Champion gains a star and Tiers Up. Each tier contains three variants with higher area requirements than the last tier. Each variant awards an additional gold chest for the Champion. There are also unique rewards for completing all three variants in a given tier. Usually these are buffs that will empower the Champion for an extended period of time, but occasionally these rewards can include skins, feats, and more.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How many Champions can I unlock in an event?</span> \r\n\r\nEach event initially contains two featured new or reworked Champions and three additional empty \"flex\" slots. You can pick which Champions you want to add to the flex slots from a fixed pool of Champions associated with the event. The first slot is available to use right away, while the other two slots can be unlocked using time gate pieces later in the event.  A sixth \"supporter\" slot is available as a \"thank you\" for players who purchase event-related DLC during the event.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I use the new Champions I've unlocked?</span> \r\n\r\nOnce you complete the Champion's base adventure, you can swap in the new Champion you've unlocked by clicking on the portrait of whomever they swap with, then clicking the swap button the top-right corner of their portrait on their character sheet. You can only have one Champion from each bench seat in your formation at a time.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I gear up the new Champions I've unlocked?</span>\r\n\r\nEquipment for event champions appear in champion-specific chests. They cannot receive gear from normal silver or gold chests. You can get champion chests by completing their event variants (1 per variant per tier, for a total of 12) or by purchasing them directly for Event Tokens or as in-app purchases. Gear for specific Champions can also be found in other types of chests, such as Electrum chests or patron-specific chests.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are Event Boons?</span>\r\n\r\nEvent Boons are additional bonuses for players who purchase event-related DLC during an event. All Event Boons provide 25,000 additional Event Tokens, and the first one you obtain during an event unlocks that event's sixth \"supporter\" flex slot. Each Event Boon also increases the level of your Boon Buff for that event. The Boon Buff provides the same effects as if you had activated all five normal potions (damage, gold find, health, click damage, and speed) at the boon's level, so for example a level 4 (Epic) Event Boon will provide the same effects as Epic Potions of Giant's Strength, Clairvoyance, Heroism, Fire Breath, and Speed. The Boon Buff maxes out at level 4.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What is the point of the event's Free Play adventures?</span> \r\n\r\nFree Play adventures in events do not award any extra chests or special rewards. They can be used, like normal adventure Free Plays, to increase your favor level without the burden of any additional variant restrictions.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens to my Event Divine Favor after the event ends?</span>\r\n\r\nOnce the event ends you'll have an opportunity to convert your Event Divine Favor into a different deity's Divine Favor for the permanent campaign of your choice, so your hard earned Event Divine Favor will not go to waste. The more Divine Favor you earn in the event, the bigger the multiplier you earn for your permanent campaign.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens to Event Currency I have left over after the event ends?</span>\r\n\r\nAny Event Currency you have left over at the end of an event will be automatically converted into Champion chests as if you spent the event currency in the shop. The chests will be randomly selected from the event's featured Champions plus any flex Champions you chose during the event. After this conversion is completed, any remaining currency will be carried forward to the next event (up to a max of 7499).\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens when I use Bounty Contracts outside of events?</span>\r\n\r\nBounty contracts used when an event is not running will add generic \"Event Currency\" items to your inventory. The next time an event starts, all the \"Event Currency\" in your inventory will be automatically converted into that event's actual currency.  This rate that  this \"Event Currency\" is awarded is the same as when you use bounty contracts during an event.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I dismantle a reworked Event Champion?</span>\r\n\r\nA dismantle will be available for reworked Champions during the event in which they are reworked, however purchasing event chests for the Champion with event tokens will end the dismantle period. Legendary dismantle events will now only occur during quarterly celebrations.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are Event Augments?</span>\r\n\r\nEvent Augments are unique modifiers that can enhance almost any aspect of an event. All players have the same Event Augments active at the same time. While some Event Augments may repeat between events, they are always changing. New or updated Event Augments may be introduced each event!"},"events_2_faq_title":{"contents":"Event FAQ"},"events_pick_champion_confirmation":{"contents":"Are you sure you want to pick $heroName?"},"EVENTTIMERDISPLAY_DAYS_HOURS_TEXT":{"contents":"99 Days 99 Hours 99 Minutes"},"EVENTYEARCHOICEOPTION_CLICK_FOR_TEXT":{"contents":"Click For Details"},"EVENTYEARCHOICEOPTION_YEAR_LOCKED_TEXT":{"contents":"Year Locked"},"EVENTYEARCHOICEPANEL_FEATURED_CHAMPION_TEXT":{"contents":"Featured Champion"},"EVENTYEARCHOICEPANEL_OTHER_CHAMPIONS_TEXT":{"contents":"Other Champions"},"EVENTYEARLOCKEDPANEL_BUY_MORE_TEXT":{"contents":"Buy More"},"EVENTYEARLOCKEDPANEL_FOR_FREE_TEXT":{"contents":"for free?

Daily voting begins on October 9th to influence the events on the Dungeons & Dragons 5E live play show. Episodes of Idle Champions Presents: Fatebreaker broadcast LIVE at twitch.tv/cnegames each Monday at 10AM-1PM Pacific starting on October 16th. There will also be rebroadcasts on Mondays from 4PM-7PM Pacific. Episodes will also be available on the Idle Champions YouTube Channel (www.youtube.com/c/IdleChampionsoftheForgottenRealms) on Tuesdays at 10AM Pacific.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I have a quick overview?</span> Each day, a new vote will become available within Idle Champions. The result of that vote will influence the tabletop D&D episode that airs the following Monday. Vote each day to get a reward token to spend on any of the daily rewards throughout the five-week event!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Wait, so this is a Livestream thing?</span> It's an everything thing! Daily votes will have both an in-game effect and a livestream effect. For example, suppose players vote for an environmental hazard for the Champions to encounter. In that case, you'll be able to see the results of that vote in the livestream episode the following Monday. Additionally, you'll be able to collect a reward token you can redeem for a reward of your choice by participating in the vote that day!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Do I have to watch the Twitch Livestream to participate?</span> No, all you have to do is play Idle Champions and vote to participate. In addition to helping craft an unforgettable show, by voting you collect reward tokens you can redeem to collect chests, potions, contracts, and even an exclusive familiar. However, for those who watch the show live, there will be giveaways from WizKids and Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse for folks from the United States and Canada (excluding Quebec) as well as international giveaways of Idle Champions DLC packs!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How long are votes available? </span> Votes are available for 24 hours starting at 12PM Pacific and ending at 12PM Pacific the following day, every Monday through Sunday. After that, the next vote becomes available, and the results of the previous day's vote are locked and become public. On Sundays, since we don't want to give away any spoilers for the next episode, there will be no active vote from 12PM Pacific until the end of the next day's episode (1PM Pacific on Monday). Once the episode airs, the next vote becomes available, with players who are active in-game at that time getting a first shot at the vote, and the new weeks' rewards!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How does voting work?</span> You get only one vote per day, so make it count! Whenever you vote, you earn a reward token that can be redeemed immediately to collect ANY of the daily rewards that have been revealed so far. If you collect 3 of the daily rewards within any week, you can collect a premium weekly reward for free - no additional reward token needed. Important Note: You must log into the game and vote to collect a reward token before the vote closes at 12pm Pacific. Make sure you come back every day so you don't miss any tokens!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are the rules for reward tokens? </span> A reward token collected on Week 1: Day 1 is the same as a reward token collected on Week 5: Day 6. You can spend those tokens on ANY of the daily rewards in ANY of the weeks.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Where are the rewards listed? </span> You can find the available reward tab on the bottom of the left column for each week. Each week has a unique list of items, and each item is available once within each week.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">When are the other daily/weekly rewards revealed? </span> The first vote for the next week will be revealed on Monday afternoons at the end of each episode, along with the daily/weekly rewards for that week.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">I can't see all the rewards. How can I choose?</span> Daily rewards each week will be a mix of Chests & other consumables. Each daily reward is collected with a single reward token. From a weekly reward standpoint: Week 1 is an exclusive familiar: Aurora the Lantern Archon. Week 2 is a Potion of the Gem Hunter. Week 3 is a Potion of Polish. Week 4 is 1000 Modron Component Pieces. And finally, week 5 is a Potion of the Gold Hunter.  'To collect a weekly reward, you only have to collect 3 of the daily rewards for that week. Collecting a weekly reward will not cost a reward token. Every day you vote allows you to collect an additional reward token!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I vote for both choices?</span> No. You can only vote once a day.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How many votes can I get each week?</span> There are 6 votes each week, and you can vote once for each vote. That means someone who is logging in and voting every day can collect 6 reward tokens each week, for a total of 30 reward tokens over the course of this event.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How long do I have to redeem a reward token? </span> Rewards will be available for the duration of the Idle Champions Presents event. The notification will turn off at 11:59 AM Pacific on November 15th, so we suggest collecting all of your rewards before then. Any remaining reward tokens will go away at the close of the Idle Champions Presents event.\r\n\r\n <span class=\"italic_title\">Do you have to vote to collect a reward token?</span> Yes.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Where can I watch Idle Champions Presents episodes?</span> Idle Champions Presents: Fatebreaker broadcasts for 5 episodes, starting on Monday, October 16th and ending on Monday, November 13th. All episodes broadcast LIVE from 10AM-1PM Pacific on the Codename Entertainment Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/cnegames/) with a rebroadcast at 4PM-7PM Pacific. If you miss the initial livestream or rebroadcast you can watch the video on demand on Twitch or on the Idle Champions YouTube (www.youtube.com/c/IdleChampionsoftheForgottenRealms) the following day after 10AM Pacific.\r\n\r\nWe'll also have a special LIVE Idle Insights Aftershow with the entire cast on Novemeber 20th at 10AM Pacific on the same Twitch channel!\r\n"},"id":{"contents":"ID"},"idle_champions_account_linked_twitch":{"contents":"Your Idle Champions account is currently linked to a Twitch account named"},"idol_ad_text":{"contents":"Get 25% more idols by watching a word from our sponsors."},"idol_ad_title":{"contents":"Idol Bonus!"},"idol_bonus_text":{"contents":", plus $(num)% bonus"},"if_issue_prevents_playing":{"contents":"If your issue is preventing you from playing please continue to use a Support Ticket for the play issue and report any bugs via the tool separately."},"if_youd_like_to_add_something":{"contents":"If you would like to add something to this ticket or repond to a response from the support team, please type it in the box below and click the button."},"ilevel":{"contents":"iLevel"},"ilevels_for_hero_gear":{"contents":"$amount levels for $name's gear"},"ilvl":{"contents":"iLvl"},"immune_pop_text":{"contents":"Immune!"},"in_search_of_power_restrictions_text":{"contents":"Voronika starts in your formation and can't be removed.

It is crafted using epic equipment and Scales of Tiamat from the Trials of Mount Tiamat. In addition to the normal epic-level effect, Legendary Equipment also has a new, semi-random legendary effect that can be leveled up using additional Scales of Tiamat and Divine Favor.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get Legendary Equipment?</span>\r\n\r\nBefore you can get Legendary Equipment you must unlock the Trials of Mount Tiamat feature by completing all of the base adventures in the Descent Into Avernus campaign. Once that is done, Legendary equipment is crafted using Scales of Tiamat. You can use them to upgrade any piece of epic equipment to Legendary.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get \"Scales of Tiamat?\"</span> \r\n\r\nYou can get Scales of Tiamat by completing campaigns in the Trials of Mount Tiamat cooperative multiplayer system. The maximum number of Scales you can earn per week is based on the difficulty you do and buffs from assault party members and first-completion bonuses. See the Trials of Mount Tiamat FAQ for more information.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What effects are available on Legendary Equipment?</span>\r\n\r\nEach Champion has six possible legendary effects that will be randomly assigned to a newly crafted or reforged piece of Legendary Equipment. These effects associated with a Champion are fixed and can not change, but the order in which they will be assigned is random. You will get a new effect when you craft or reforge up until the point at which you have crafted or reforged all six possible effects, after which additional crafts or reforges will assign a random effect from those available.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What is Reforging Legendary Equipment?</span>\r\n\r\nIf you aren't satisfied with the effect chosen for a given piece of Legendary Equipment you can reforge it to get a new effect. The cost to reforge increases drastically with each reforge, but is subsequently reduced by 10% each day down to a minimum cost. You will get a brand new effect when you reforge up until the point at which you have crafted or reforged all six effects, after which any additional crafts or reforges will assign a random effect from those available. Reforging Legendary Equipment does not reset its legendary level. Reforging also picks a new Divine Favor type for the purposes of leveling up.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I level up Legendary Equipment?</span>\r\n\r\nLegendary Equipment can be leveled up using Scales of Tiamat and Divine Favor. The number of Scales required is determined by the current legendary level of the equipment. When legendary equipment is crafted a random evergreen Divine Favor is chosen to be associated with it. You must have a minimum amount of that Divine Favor in order to level up that piece of equipment. Leveling up equipment will also permanently consume one order of magnitude of that divine favor.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What does leveling up Legendary Equipment do?</span>\r\n\r\nIncreasing the legendary level of Legendary Equipment doubles its legendary effect. It does not affect the normal epic effect.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I convert Legendary Equipment back to Epic?</span>\r\n\r\nIn general, once an item is upgraded to Legendary it cannot be changed back to Epic., but when a Champion is dismantled, Legendary items are reverted to epic and Legendary potions are awarded.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I remove legendary levels from Legendary Equipment?</span>\r\n\r\nIn general, once an item is leveled up it can not be reverted back to a lower level., but when a Champion is dismantled, Legendary items are reverted to epic and Legendary potions are awarded."},"legendary_forge":{"contents":"Forge"},"legendary_forge_bonuses":{"contents":"Forging a Legendary will randomly add one of the following bonuses"},"legendary_forge_cost_description":{"contents":"Forge cost increases with each use"},"legendary_forge_legendary":{"contents":"Forge Legendary"},"legendary_forge_title":{"contents":"Legendary Forge"},"legendary_level":{"contents":"(Level $amount)"},"legendary_maximum_level_reached":{"contents":"Legendary is at the maximum level"},"legendary_next_reduction":{"contents":"Next reduction"},"legendary_possible_bonuses":{"contents":"Possible Bonuses"},"legendary_rebalance_addendum":{"contents":"You previously had $amount Legendaries over the new level $maxLevel cap.

To begin, assign a Modron Core to an adventuring party. Next, use components you find in Modron Component Chests to route Polymorphic Energy from the Energy Generator into the Modron Automation Component and Modron Core Outputs. While the automation tile does not require a specific amount of power, using certain components to increase the power of the flow can provide larger buffs from the Modron Core Outputs. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I enable the Setup Automation button?</span> In order to enable the \"Setup Automation\" button you must route power from the Energy Generator to the Modron Automation Component using components you find in Modron Component Chests. <span class=\"italic_title\">What can be automated?</span> You can currently automate three things: 1. Formation loading. When enabled your Modron Core will automatically load a specific saved formation when you begin an adventure with the adventuring party it is assigned to. The saved formation chosen depends on the campaign/event/year/patron of the adventure you start. Different saved formations can be chosen for different campaigns/events/years/patrons and can be chosen by using the selector at the bottom of the automation dialog. 2. Automatic resets. When enabled your Modron Core will automatically reset and restart your adventure when you complete a given area. This only functions when you are on a free play adventure and for event free plays will only trigger if you have enough event currency to start the free play again. When combined with formation loading this can automate farming of gems, patron currencies, challenges, and more. 3. Automatic buffs. When enabled your Modron Core will automatically use certain potions upon reaching certain areas. This can allow you to increase the efficiency of your automatic runs, provided you have enough potions available. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get more Modron Components?</span> You can get Modron Components from Modron Component Chests. Chests are awarded when you unlock a Modron Core or level up a Modron Core, and may also be purchased for Patron Currency in limited quantities. Finally, Modron Component Chests will be available in the premium store at a future date. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I upgrade components?</span> Modron Components can be upgraded to the next rarity level by using Modron Component Pieces. You get pieces by breaking down components you don't want to keep. It takes more pieces to upgrade higher rarity components, but you also get more components for breaking down higher rarity components. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I get more Modron Cores?</span> An additional Modron Core is available for purchase on the Current Parties dialog by pressing the \"Buy Additional Cores\" button at the bottom. More cores will be added in the future. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I unlock more areas in my Modron Core Grid?</span> Modron Cores gain one xp every time the party they are assigned to completes an area. When they level up you get a Modron Component Chest and unlock a new region of the grid with new space and outputs and explore. <span class=\"italic_title\">My Modron is Overheating! How do I prevent that?</span> Modron Cores will overheat if there is an infinite loop in your component layout. To avoid this, look for areas of red flow and rearrange your components so that the flow does not flow back into itself. While a Modron Core is overheating none of the outputs or automation tasks will function. <span class=\"italic_title\">Why did my Modron Core stop automating after a week when I left it for two weeks?</span> Modron Cores can only automate for seven days before they need to be checked in on. To prevent your Modron Core from pausing its automation, simply open up the core dialog once every seven days."},"modron_shop":{"contents":"Modron Shop"},"modron_supercharge_next_threshold":{"contents":"Next bonus at: $nextThreshold."},"modron_supercharge_tooltip":{"contents":"Supercharged: Starting at 500 flow, every time the flow level doubles, increase the effect by 25%, up to a maximum bonus of 500%.

It allows you to replay previously completed variants and free plays with additional restrictions, and rewards you with patron currency and influence which can be used to purchase unique rewards and unlock unique perks. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I use the patron system?</span> On PC and mobile platforms, click the new patron button on the top-left menu next to the reset button. On consoles, find the patron panel within the normal menu system. Once there, you can see the available patrons listed on the left. Each patron has a unique set of requirements you must meet and costs you must pay before they will accept you as a follower. Pay their price and you can begin to collect patron influence and currency by starting variants and free plays with the given patron active. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron requirements and costs?</span> Patron requirements and costs are requirements you must meet and costs you must pay before you can begin to adventure on behalf of a given patron. Requirements include things like having a certain number of Champions unlocked, having a certain number of adventures completed, or even having a certain number of loot levels across all of your Champions' equipment. Costs currently include gems, time gate fragments, and silver chests. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron restrictions?</span> Each patron comes with unique restrictions that apply to every variant or free play adventure you do while that patron is enabled. They apply in addition to the normal restrictions on a given variant, and can make the variant much, much more challenging. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are the first two patrons and their restrictions?</span> The initial iteration of the patron system will launch with two patrons: Mirt the Moneylender and Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff. Mirt requires all Champions take a side in the great battle between good and evil, and will not allow neutral Champions to partake in his adventures. Vajra, on the other hand, requires Champions of great constitution to do her bidding, and therefore does not allow Champions with a CON score of 13 or lower to represent her interests. Vajra's unlock requirements are slightly higher than Mirt's, as are her area requirements in her variants. <span class=\"italic_title\">How do I use my patron?</span> Once you've unlocked a patron, you can activate them on the campaign map after you've completed your current adventure. Look on the right-hand side of the screen to see the patron selector. When active, the campaign map will show you all available patron variants and free plays for your chosen patron. You can disable your patron in order to do normal adventures. Once you start an adventure you can not switch or disable your patron without first completing the adventure. Patrons are not available to use during event campaigns or time gate adventures. Switching to an event campaign or opening the time gate dialog will disable your current patron temporarily. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron variants?</span> Patron variants are versions of all the normal adventure variants that you can start with an active patron, but include the patron's additional restrictions and have a much higher area requirement. You must complete the base adventure variant before you can do the patron variant. Patron variants award patron influence and currency based on the area requirement of the adventure, along with normal divine favor rewards. You only get the influence and currency if you complete the objective. Going beyond the area requirement does not increase the reward. Like normal variants, patron variants can only be completed once. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron free plays?</span> Patron free plays are versions of the normal adventure free plays you can start with an active patron. Unlike patron variants, patron free plays do not award patron influence, but do award currency based on the area you reach, along with normal divine favor rewards. There is a maximum of 5,000 patron currency that can be earned from patron free plays each week, and after that, you will only gain normal divine favor rewards for completing patron free plays. Additional patron currency can be earned by completing patron variants or patron challenges. <span class=\"italic_title\">What is patron influence?</span> Patron influence is earned by completing patron variants and can be used to purchase patron perks. The amount of influence earned from variants is fixed and can not be increased. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron perks?</span> Patron perks are similar to blessings, and can be unlocked with patron influence on the patron dialog to increase your party's effectiveness. Some patron perks only apply while adventuring under your patron banner, while others apply globally on any adventure for any patron (or even no patron). <span class=\"italic_title\">What is patron currency?</span> Patron currency is earned by completing patron variants, patron free plays, and patron challenges. Patron currency can be used to purchase unique rewards from the patron shop. There is a limit to the amount of patron currency you can earn from patron free plays and challenges each week, but there is no limit to the amount you can earn by completing patron variants (though there are a limited number of variants available). <span class=\"italic_title\">What can I buy in the patron shop?</span> The patron shop allows you to purchase unique items using patron currency. The first items available are patron chests, which contain loot items for any of the Champions available to use on the given patron's variants and free plays, including event Champions. Additional items in the patron shop may require that you have a certain amount of patron influence before you can buy them, but include potions, time gate fragments, feats, skins, silver event chests, and familiars. Some items have a weekly limit on the number you can purchase, and others are only one-time purchases. Note: Some patron shop items, such as skins, familiars, and silver event chests, are not being released with the launch of the system and will be added later. <span class=\"italic_title\">What are patron challenges?</span> Patron challenges are another way to earn patron currency each week. They are a set of 8 challenges, similar to The \"C\" Team challenges we did earlier this year, that you can complete each week. You must be on a patron variant or free play in order to make progress towards that patron's challenges. Patron challenges can award 5,000 additional patron currency for completing them all each week, separate from the free play currency cap. Note: The patron challenge system is not launching with the initial patron system, but will be added after several weeks. <span class=\"italic_title\">How often will you be adding new patrons?</span> We do not yet have a firm cadence for new patron releases, but we hope to release many more patrons in the future and expand the system in other ways as well. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback about the patron system and may make changes in the future based on it. <span class=\"italic_title\">Does this mean we're going to get less new adventures in the future?</span> We do not believe the patron system will impact the cadence of our new adventure and variant releases -- in fact, it will lead to more content being available because every time we release new variants they will be available to play with any unlocked patron you have as soon as you have completed the base variant."},"PATRONSELECTDISPLAYITEM_ACTIVATE_TEXT":{"contents":"Activate"},"PATRONSELECTDISPLAYITEM_ACTIVE_PATRON_TEXT":{"contents":"Active Patron"},"PATRONSELECTDISPLAYITEM_DETAILS_TEXT":{"contents":"Details"},"PATRONSELECTDISPLAYITEM_NO_PATRON_TEXT":{"contents":"No Patron"},"PATRONSHOPPANEL_HIDE_UNAVAILABLE_TEXT":{"contents":"Hide unavailable items"},"PATRONSHOPPANEL_LIMITED_STOCK_TEXT":{"contents":"Limited Stock:"},"PATRONSHOPPANEL_NEXT_SHOP_TEXT":{"contents":"Next shop reset in:"},"PATRONSHOPPANEL_REMAINING_PURCHASES_TEXT":{"contents":"Remaining purchases this week"},"PATRONSHOPPANEL_SHOP_RESET_TEXT":{"contents":"Shop reset!"},"pause":{"contents":"Pause"},"payments_contacting_platform":{"contents":"Contacting Platform"},"pending_transaction":{"contents":"Transaction pending"},"per_quest":{"contents":"Per Quest:"},"percent_chance_to_miss":{"contents":"$percent% Chance to Miss"},"percent_complete":{"contents":"Percent Complete"},"percent_off":{"contents":"-$value%"},"performed_a_purchase_on":{"contents":"Performed a purchase on"},"performed_soft_currency_purchase_on":{"contents":"Performed Soft Currency Purchase on"},"PERKS_TEXT":{"contents":"Perks"},"perks_unlocked":{"contents":"Perks Unlocked"},"permissions_allow":{"contents":"Allow"},"permissions_denied":{"contents":"If you have selected \"Don't Ask Again\", you can re-enable permissions for Crusaders Of The Lost Idols by going to your Settings app, and choosing Apps->Crusaders Of The Lost Idols->Permissions"},"permissions_settings_note":{"contents":"* If you don't want to enable these permissions now, you can always turn them back on from the settings menu"},"permissions_title":{"contents":"Permissions"},"permissions_understand":{"contents":"I Understand"},"permissions_warning":{"contents":"WARNING!"},"pick_champion_caps":{"contents":"PICK CHAMPION"},"pick_formation_to_be_loaded":{"contents":"Pick a formation to be automatically loaded during adventures on the selected campaign."},"pick_random_champion_skins":{"contents":"Pick random Champion Skins"},"pick_random_champion_skins_tooltip":{"contents":"If enabled, all Champions will pick a random skin at the start of each new adventure.\r\nIn order to manually select a champion skin, this setting must first be disabled."},"pick_up":{"contents":"Pick Up"},"picking_champion_request":{"contents":"Picking Champion..."},"picking_trials_role":{"contents":"Picking Trials role!"},"pickup":{"contents":"Pickup"},"pickup_items":{"contents":"Pickup Items"},"piece_cannot_be_upgraded_further":{"contents":"This piece cannot be upgraded further."},"pigment_select_champion_description":{"contents":"Select a $tag Champion to apply the $pigment_name to one of their equipment items. $pigment_effect_desc."},"pigments":{"contents":"Pigments"},"platinum_daily_plus":{"contents":"DAILY PLUS"},"play_every_day":{"contents":"Play Every Day!"},"play_sound_in_background":{"contents":"Play sound when in background"},"PLAY_TEXT":{"contents":"Play"},"player":{"contents":"Player"},"player_attack":{"contents":"Player Attack"},"player_survey_button":{"contents":"Go to Survey"},"player_survey_close":{"contents":"Not Interested"},"player_survey_contents":{"contents":"As a valued member of the Idle Champions community, we'd love to hear your thoughts!

During a Season, you can complete weekly, Season-long, and bonus quests, increase your Season level, and claim Season Rewards. Seasons have a wide variety of rewards for players of all levels, including exclusive skins, feats, and even modron cores!\r\n\r\nEach season focuses on a group of five existing Champions. The chosen Champions receive (potentially major) balance changes at the start of the Season, and the rewards for the season are focused on those five Champions.\r\n\r\nWhat can I earn during Seasons?\r\n\r\nSeason rewards include basic items like potions, chests, and contracts, but also include unique items such as skins, feats, and even a modron core. There are also exclusive one-time item level boosts for the Season Champions, meaning those Season Champions will come out of the Season with a significant amount of power!\r\n\r\nThere is also a Season-long Buff that gets more powerful as you level up your Season level or buy rewards, and focuses on buffing the season Champions. If a Season has a modron core as a reward, the core's outputs will usually mimic some of the Champion-specific power gained from the Season Buff.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Season you can convert your Season favor into favor for ALL of your permanent campaigns deities. It's like a super event in that respect, so even if the other rewards don't get you excited, there's still something useful to farm for.\r\n\r\nDo I need to buy a Season Pass to participate?\r\n\r\nA Season pass is not required to participate in the Season system, though many of the more exclusive rewards (which would normally be included in DLC packs) require it. You can complete Season quests, claim many rewards, and convert your Season favor when the Season ends all without a Season pass.\r\n\r\nWhat are Season Quests?\r\n\r\nSeason Quests are like patron challenges. They come in three varieties: Seasonal Quests, Milestone Quests, and Bonus Quests. All Season Quests reward Season XP and Season Favor when completed.\r\n\r\nSeven Seasonal Quests are released each week. You have until the end of the Season to complete these quests, though only ten of them can be active at a time, so don't delay! These are generally more challenging quests that will require a bit more time or imagination to complete.\r\n\r\nTen Milestone Quests are available from the very beginning of the season, each of which has ten tiers. Completing one tier of a Milestone Quest will unlock the next tier of that Milestone Quest. These are challenging long-term Quests which will require significant investment to complete all ten tiers.\r\n\r\nBonus Quests award additional Season XP which can be used to speed up your progress through a season or earn additional Bonus Tokens. The additional Season XP from Bonus Quests is not required to complete the Season Reward Track (aka. reach level 60) and therefore you do not need to do any Bonus Quests to complete a season if you don't want to.\r\n\r\nWhat is Season XP?\r\n\r\nSeason XP is earned by completing Season Quests and is used to increase your Season Level. When you level up you unlock new rewards and may unlock an additional effect for your Season Buff.\r\n\r\nWhat is Season Favor?\r\n\r\nSeason Favor is earned by completing Season Quests. When a Season ends, you will convert your Season Favor into favor for all of your unlocked permanent campaigns, so the more you have the bigger your boost will be!\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a Season ends?\r\n\r\nWhen a Season ends, all incomplete Season Quests are abandoned, any unclaimed rewards are automatically redeemed, and your Season Favor can be converted into favor for all of your unlocked permanent campaign deities (this must be done within a week of the season ending, just like at the end of events).\r\n\r\nUnclaimed premium items will be added to the wild offer pool at some time in the future.\r\n\r\nWill there be more Seasons in the future?\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to run multiple Seasons per year, using them as an opportunity to highlight and potentially majorly rework up to twenty Champions per year."},"seasons_faq_title":{"contents":"Seasons FAQ"},"second_adventure_area_num":{"contents":"Second Adventure - Area $areaNum"},"second_ago":{"contents":"1 second ago"},"second_upgrade_affects_1_champ":{"contents":"Second $upgradeName affects 1 champion for $amount% total bonus"},"second_upgrade_affects_count_champs":{"contents":"Second $upgradeName affects $count champions for $amount% total bonus"},"second_word":{"contents":"Second"},"second_word_abbreviated":{"contents":"s"},"second_word_plural":{"contents":"Seconds"},"seconds_ago":{"contents":"$value seconds ago"},"seconds_until_next_reduction":{"contents":"$timeLeft seconds until next reduction"},"see_all_objectives":{"contents":"See All Objectives"},"see_nintendo_eshop":{"contents":"See Nintendo eShop"},"see_top_notification":{"contents":"See the notification at the top for more details about the $name."},"seen_monsters":{"contents":"Encountered Enemies"},"seen_state":{"contents":"Encountered State"},"select":{"contents":"Select"},"select_champion":{"contents":"Select Champion"},"select_champion_to_reset":{"contents":"Select a Champion to reset Specializations"},"select_familiar":{"contents":"Select Familiar"},"select_hero":{"contents":"Select Hero"},"select_language_title":{"contents":"Select Language"},"select_loot":{"contents":"Select"},"select_modron":{"contents":"Select Modron"},"select_section":{"contents":"Select Section"},"select_specialization":{"contents":"Select Specialization"},"SELECT_TEXT":{"contents":"Select"},"SELECTED_TEXT":{"contents":"Selected"},"selecting_play_server":{"contents":"Selecting Play Server"},"self_dps_upgrade":{"contents":"Self DPS Upgrade"},"SEND_TEXT":{"contents":"Send"},"sending_collection_request":{"contents":"Requesting Collection data..."},"sending_gq_claim_request":{"contents":"Claiming reward..."},"sending_seen_sending_stones":{"contents":"Sending Seen Sending Stones!"},"sending_vote":{"contents":"Sending Vote!"},"server_request_waiting_message_adding_chests":{"contents":"Adding Chests!!!!..."},"server_request_waiting_message_adding_idols":{"contents":"Adding Idols!!!!..."},"server_request_waiting_message_authenticating_steam":{"contents":"Authenticating Steam..."},"server_request_waiting_message_buying":{"contents":"Buying..."},"server_request_waiting_message_checking_account":{"contents":"Checking Account..."},"server_request_waiting_message_claiming_bonus_items":{"contents":"Claiming Bonus Items..."},"server_request_waiting_message_claiming_purchased_items":{"contents":"Claiming Purchased Items..."},"server_request_waiting_message_completing_quest":{"contents":"Completing Quest!

However, like many organizations' websites, our web server automatically logs certain non-identifying information related to a user's visit to the website, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer, the user's Internet service provider (ISP), the type and version of the browser that the user is using, the date and time the user accessed our website, the Internet address of the website from which the user linked directly to our site, the operating system that the user is using, and the pages of the website that the user has visited.

We may, however, review server logs and anonymous traffic for system administration and security purposes, for example to detect intrusions into our network, for planning and improving web services, and to monitor and compile statistics about website usage. The possibility therefore exists that server log data, which contains users' IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals. In such instances, we may share raw data logs with the appropriate authorities for the purpose of investigating security breaches. We also use cookies, analytics, pixels and other technologies in order to improve our service and your user experience, to analyze how the Site is used, and to assist with the planning and design of our games, our business and marketing.

These portals, or Time Gates as they were known, were powerful creations of magic that have become lost to time. Mystra, the goddess of magic, has foreseen great challenges coming for the Champions and has granted one of her chosen, Kaylaar, the power to open Time Gates to assist you in your quests. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: OK, so that's the lore-filled explanation. But what does that really mean?</span> A: Time Gates are a feature for Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms. They are an avenue by which you can earn Champions from previous events that you may have missed, and/or gear them up for free. Once a Champion's Time Gate is open you'll be able to replay the event adventure they are tied to, and collect up to 3 gold chests for the Champion, plus a number of silver Champion chests based on how far you can progress. If you haven't unlocked the champion in the past, you'll also earn that champion when you complete the first Time Gate adventure. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: How often are Time Gates available?</span> A: Natural Time Gates will be opened by Kaylaar approximately every 3 weeks (give or take). Natural Time Gates allow you to pick from one of three randomly chosen Champions and open their Time Gate for free. If you use Time Gate Pieces you can choose to open a Time Gate for any Champion you want at any time. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: What are Time Gate Pieces?</span> A: Bosses can drop Time Gate Pieces. These are extremely rare drops which have a long cooldown, so farming bosses will not increase your drop rate. Once you collect 6 of those pieces, you can ask Kaylaar to open a Champion Time Gate outside of the Natural Time Gate period. Time Gate pieces can also be found in some premium package deals and are common in wild offers. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: My Natural Time Gate has different champions available than my friend's Natural Time Gate. Is that a bug?</span> A: No. The champions for each player are randomly chosen based on the champions they have collected already. If possible, there will always be at least one event Champion you haven't unlocked available in your Natural Time Gates. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: What do I have to do to collect the displayed Time Gate rewards?</span> A: The first time you select any given Champion through the time gate, you'll need to complete three runs to collect the main rewards: one to area 50, one to area 75, and one of a random variant from that Champion's event. You can also earn silver Champion chests by defeating the bosses at area 100, 200, 300, etc. These silver chests will only be awarded once per boss per Time Gate. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: How is the variant adventure chosen?</span> A: The variant adventure is chosen at random from the three that were originally associated with the Champion during the Champion's original event. If you have not previously completed all of the valid variants, the system will choose one of the incomplete ones, so if you're starting from scratch you will encounter all three within three time gates. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: I just triggered a Time Gate and the areas I have to reach are higher than 50 & 75. Why is that?</span> A: The first time you select a champion, the areas you have to reach are 50 & 75. The next time that champion is available within a Time Gate, the target areas are increased for each area-based objective you previously completed, so you'll have to get to areas 100 & 125. This effect stacks if you continue to choose the same Champion for all of your Time Gates, making their rewards harder and harder to get. However, if you don't choose that champion when it's available, the *next* time that champion becomes available the required levels will drop by 25 (to a minimum of 50 & 75). <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: How long are Time Gates open for?</span> A: Time Gates are available for only 72 hours after they are opened, whether they are opened through the normal event cadence or through your collected Time Gate pieces. If you wait until later in a Natural Time Gate weekend to pick a free gate, that gate will still be available for 72 hours, regardless of how much time was left in the free weekend. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: Do I gain divine favor during a Time Gate event?</span> A: Yes, you gain favor with Mystra, and you'll be forced to convert it once the Time Gate closes, just like normal events. The conversion ratio is much smaller than normal events. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: What happens if I close a Time Gate early?</span> A: You immediately lose access to that Time Gate's adventure, so you can't earn any more Mystra favor or rewards. You will get up to two Time Gate Pieces as compensation for the missed rewards (minus one for each reward claimed) and must immediately convert any Mystra favor you have earned. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: If I decide I don't want to collect the champion's available for free, can I choose a different champion?</span> A: Yes, you can choose to open a Time Gate using Time Gate Pieces even during a free Time Gate weekend. The free Champions will still be available for the entire weekend, so you can close your new gate early and then pick from one of the free ones anytime before the free Time Gate weekend ends. Once you have chosen one of the free Time Gate Champions, the others will no longer be free. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: I opened the time gate, but I didn't collect all the rewards. What happens?</span> A: You will get up to two Time Gate Pieces as compensation for missed rewards, so if a Time Gate becomes available and you chose a champion, but you are unable to complete any of the objectives, you'll find 2 additional Time Gate pieces in your inventory when the Time Gate closes. If you complete one of the objectives, you will only receive one Time Gate Piece, and if you complete two of the three objectives you will receive none. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: Can I earn missed event achievements during Time Gate adventures?</span> A: Time Gates adventures do not count towards 'Reach area X in Free Play' event achievements, but because a random event variant will be offered with each Time Gate, you *can* complete the \"Complete all of the Event Variants\" achievement for the given Champion over the course of up to three runs. The system will always pick a variant that you have not yet completed, or a random variant if you have already completed all three. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: Does the Tier 2 Kelemvor global blessing increase my Mystra favor earned?</span> A: No, Time Gates are not technically part of an event campaign, so the Kelemvor blessing does not increase your favor earned when you complete the adventure. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: Can I carry my Mystra favor over between Time Gates?</span> A: No, you must convert your Mystra Favor immediately upon starting a new adventure and will not be able to use it in a new Time Gate even if you open another one immediately. <span class=\"italic_title\">Q: Who is the woman controlling the Time Gates. Is that Mystra?</span> A: No. That is Kaylaar Allun, a powerful wizard and a chosen of Mystra. She has reached out to the champions under the bidding of her goddess, Mystra.

to earn currency used to power up your Champions' equipment items. In it you will take part in an epic battle against the forces of Tiamat, the Mad Dragon Queen, who has recently escaped to Faerun and threatens to destroy the whole of reality. You will battle to distract, disrupt, and destroy the Dragon Queen's forces in conjunction with up to four other players in a last ditch effort to banish Tiamat back to Avernus and save the world.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I unlock this feature?</span>\r\n\r\nBefore you can take part in the Trials of Mount Tiamat you must have battled Tiamat at the end of the Descent Into Avernus campaign and then completed the introductory adventure by clicking the Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign button on the campaign map. Once that is done, a new dialog will appear in the game which will let you create and join active Trials of Mount Tiamat campaigns.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What is a Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign?</span>\r\n\r\nA Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign is a multiplayer group campaign that lasts for seven days once it has been started. In a campaign, five players must complete five different Trials in order to distract, disrupt, and destroy the Dragon Queen's forces in order to banish Tiamat and save the world.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I create a Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign?</span>\r\n\r\nOnce you've unlocked the Trials of Mount Tiamat feature you can start a campaign on the main Trials of Mount Tiamat dialog. You do so by picking the campaign difficulty and the currency you will use to start it. Normal campaigns have no cost or requirements to create, but higher difficulty campaigns require you to have defeated Tiamat at the difficulty below it and pay a currency cost in order to start it. Once you have created a campaign, you can select your Trial and nominate your Assault Front Champion. You may then wait for up to four additional players to join and \"ready up\" before you start it. You do not have to pay the starting currency costs until you start the campaign.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I join a Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign?</span>\r\n\r\nOnce you've unlocked the Trials of Mount Tiamat feature you can join a campaign on the main Trials of Mount Tiamat dialog. You can view a list of available campaigns started by other players or input a campaign code to join a specific one (someone who started a campaign can give you one that will let you join their campaign). You can filter by the difficulty of the campaign and/or the available Trials. You can only join campaigns at most one difficulty higher than the highest difficulty at which you have defeated Tiamat.\r\n\r\nOnce you have joined a campaign you must pick a Trial to attempt and nominate your Assault Front Champion in order to \"ready-up\".\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What are the \"Trials\" and how do I pick one?</span>\r\n\r\nThe \"Trials\" of Mount Tiamat are five unique adventures that take place on, around, or under Mount Tiamat, and focus on distracting, disrupting, and destroying the Dragon Queen's forces so that the Assault Front Champions can engage her directly in order to banish her back to Avernus. The five trials are the Forest Trial, the Swamp Trial, the Mountain Trial, the Plains Trial, and the Underground Trial. The monsters and environments you battle in vary from Trial to Trial, and there are rewards for completing each Trial for the first time, but other than that it doesn't make a difference which Trial you choose on any given week.\r\n\r\nYou must pick a Trial before a campaign you create or join can be started. Only one player can pick each Trial each week.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What is an \"Assault Front Champion\" and how do I pick one?</span>\r\n\r\nEach player who joins a campaign selects one of their roster's Champions to join the Assault Front. The Assault Front is where Champions directly engage Tiamat, taking advantage of the distractions from the players' Trials in order to deal damage over time and attempt to reduce Tiamat's health to zero and force her into the Red Wizard's trap.\r\n\r\nPlayers will be unable to use their chosen Assault Front Champion while the campaign is active, however these Champions are not completely disabled. They will provide buffs to all players on the campaign based on their role(s) and their item level, so sending more popular, more powerful Champions to the Assault Front will result in higher buffs to each party. Choose carefully!\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What can I do during a Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign?</span>\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Trials of Mount Tiamat campaign is to reduce Tiamat's health to zero. To do so, players must increase their DPS contribution by doing their chosen Trial adventure. For specifics of how to increase your DPS contribution, see questions further below. Aside from doing your Trial adventure, you can also use scrolls to increase the damage, gold find, and assault party dps contribution of all players' parties. You can also read Sending Stone messages from the Assault Front Champions as they update the party on the progress of their battle against Tiamat.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How is my DPS contribution calculated?</span>\r\n\r\nDPS done by each player is primarily acquired by completing the area objective in their Trials adventure each day.  These DPS contributions stack additively on top of each other  and can greatly increase your party's total DPS.\r\n\r\nEach player also receives additional DPS equal to the exponent of the total damage done by that player's formation on their Trials adventure throughout the week. For example if a player has done 1.0e50 damage in total throughout the week, this contribution will be 50.  This DPS contribution stacks additively with the Area Objective contribution.\r\n\r\nFinally, Scrolls of Assault can be used to increase the DPS contribution of all players in the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do I increase my DPS contribution?</span>\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to increase your DPS contribution:\r\n\r\n1. Complete your daily area goal in your Trials adventure. This can be a big boost to your DPS contribution and you can do this once per day.\r\n\r\n2. Deal more total damage in your Trials adventure. Your base DPS number is based on the exponent of the total damage done by your party in your Trials adventure during the campaign week. For example if you've done 1.0e50 damage in total throughout the week, your base DPS number will be 50. The total damage use to calculate your base DPS is cumulative throughout the week.\r\n\r\n3. Use Scrolls of Assault. These scrolls can be found in Glory of Bahamut chests and increase the DPS contribution of all players in your campaign.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens on my Trial Adventure?</span>\r\n\r\nBy battling through your Trial Adventure, you will increase your DPS contribution to the Assault Front party. See the section about how your DPS contribution is calculated for more details.\r\n\r\nYou can reset your Trial Adventure multiple times a day, but will always be forced to reset at the end of the day. This is because each day, the battle against Tiamat gets harder. You start out on day one with a single, simple restriction on the adventure, such as \"Only Champions with STR 10+ can be used\", but each day a new restriction is added, making the fight to reach your daily area goal even harder.\r\n\r\nYou will earn Bahamut favor by resetting your Trial Adventure, which can be converted to the permanent favor of your choice after the campaign has ended.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What rewards can I earn from the Trials of Mount Tiamat?</span>\r\n\r\nEvery time you complete a campaign, based on how much damage you do to Tiamat over the course of the campaign, you receive Scales of Tiamat, which can be used to forge and upgrade Legendary equipment. If you manage to bring Tiamat's health to zero and banish her back to Avernus you will receive a bonus of 50% more Scales. You may also receive 1 or more Glory of Bahamut chests for defeating Tiamat. The higher the difficulty level of the campaign, the more Scales and Chests you can get.\r\n\r\nThere are also some one-time rewards you can receive for defeating Tiamat. The first time you defeat Tiamat on each difficulty, your Scales of Tiamat reward will be multiplied by 3. Additionally, the first time you defeat Tiamat after taking part in each Trial you will receive a special Champion Skin. Note that these one time rewards may change or be renewed over time.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">My Campaign has ended but I can't claim rewards! Why not?</span>\r\n\r\nOnce a Campaign has ended, each player is given 24 hours to check-in in-case they have offline progress that would aid in the battle against Tiamat. Once all players have checked in, or 24 hours have passed since the campaign ended, all players can claim their rewards, and any additional check-ins by tardy players will not affect the campaign's outcome.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I start another Campaign while I wait for players from my old one to check in?</span>\r\n\r\nYes, you can create or join another campaign immediately after your campaign ends, however you may need to wait to claim the campaign rewards from your old one. You can claim these rewards through buttons on the dialog even after you've started a new campaign.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">What happens if we defeat Tiamat before the week is over?</span>\r\n\r\nIf you manage to bring Tiamat's health to zero before the week ends you will be able to claim your rewards immediately. No matter what happens, you can not create or join a new campaign until six days have passed since your previous campaign started.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Explain to me how Tiamat's health bar works?</span>\r\n\r\nTiamat's health bar takes constant damage based on your party's combined DPS. There is also a bonus section that you may notice. This bonus damage is equal to damage that would have happened if your party was doing their maximum damage for the entire day, and is dealt in one big chunk at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How is it possible to do enough damage to banish Tiamat? Especially when the Trial Adventures get harder every day, so it's harder and harder to do more damage in the Trials?</span>\r\n\r\nThe key is the bonus DPS you get from reaching your area goal every day. That bonus DPS will be your primary avenue of increasing your campaign's DPS as you get later into the week, so finding a party that can battle through the Trial restrictions to reach the daily area goal should be your main goal each day.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How do higher difficulties affect the campaign?</span>\r\n\r\nHigher difficulties increase both Tiamat's max health and the maximum number of Scales of Tiamat you can earn for damaging and defeating Tiamat. Since you are limited to one campaign per week, your best bet is to fight Tiamat in the highest difficulty you are confident you can defeat her in.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">Can I leave a campaign part-way through?</span>\r\n\r\nNo, you can not leave a campaign once it has started. If you join a campaign you may leave before the campaign owner starts it, and as a campaign owner you can abandon your campaign any time before you start it, which will cause everyone in the campaign to be removed.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"italic_title\">How can I help my campaign do better?</span>\r\n\r\nAside from increasing your own DPS contribution, you can use scrolls which increase the damage and gold find of all campaign members while on their Trials adventure. The Champion you choose to send to the assault front will also affect the group, as the type of buff they provide is based on the Champions' role and the magnitude of the buff is based on their item level -- the higher the better. Sending your highest geared Champion will help your team deal more damage."},"trials_hero_select_description_text":{"contents":"Select a Champion to send to fight Tiamat on your Assault team.
